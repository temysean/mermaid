 <h1>MERMAIDS AND FAIRIES</h1>
 <h2>MERMAIDS</h2>
 <h3>What are mermaids?</h3>
 <p>A mermaid is an aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish.</p>
<h3>Where are mermaids from?</h3>
<p>One of the earliest mermaid legends appeared in Syria around 1000 BC when the goddess Atargatis dove into a lake to take the form of a fish. As the gods there would not allow her to give up her great beauty, only her bottom half became a fish, and she kept her top half in human form.</p>
<h3>Where can  mermaids be found?</h3>
<p>For centuries, these mythical creatures have captured the imagination of sailors and landlubbers alike.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fujinomiya, Japan. Tenshou-Kyousha Shrine Mermaid Mummy.</li>
    <li>Apollo Beach, Florida. Big Bend Power Plant Manatee Viewing Area.</li>
    <li>Grafton, Vermont. The Nature Museum Feejee Mermaid.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who was the first person to see a mermaid?</h3>
<p>In January 1493, Christopher Columbus and his crew were sailing near the Dominican Republic when the famous explorer announced he saw something peculiar in the water.</p>
<h3>What powers do mermaids have?</h3>
<p>Mermaids are often depicted as having powers such as the ability to lure sailors with their enchanting voices, breathe underwater, and control the sea and its creatures. They are also sometimes believed to have the power of prophecy.</p>
<h3>What attract mermaids?</h3>
<p>Mermaids often pluck pearls from oysters and use them as decoration. They'll be attracted to the pearl's sheen and come up out of the water to investigate like a fish to a lure. Mermaids are actually quite vain. They love sitting atop rocks and staring down at their reflections.</p>
<h3>How long do mermaids live?</h3>
<p> Mermaids live for hundreds of years, much longer than humans but they do eventually face a natural death. It is possible that mermaids can stay young forever as when Betty got back her object of power, she became young and beautiful again.</p>
<h3>Are mermaids good or bad for humans?</h3>
<p>Though sometimes kindly, mermaids were usually dangerous to humans. Their gifts brought misfortune and could cause disasters. They sometimes lured mortals to death by drowning or enticed young people to live with them underwater.</p>
<h3>We have some types of mermaids.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>NEREIDES</li>
    <img src="images/NEREIDES.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Nereids are mostly found in the Mediterranean sea and tend to hide in deep cavernous spaces within the earth. They are some of the most beautiful creatures in existence and can have either legs or tails depending on the body of water.
        Their personalities are friendly and will help sailors in times of need. They love children and often give birth to influential heirs like Achilles. You can find them hanging around the God Poseidon will often fight with each other for the chance to carry his trident.</p>
<li>NAIADES</li>
<img src="images/NAIADES.jpg" alt="">
<p>Naiades are found in most fresh bodies of water like rivers, springs, wells, and even fountains. They are, for the most part, good and nurturing spirits to people and the water in which they protect. Usually, these freshwater sources are the main life-giving current to which nearby civilizations are built. Offerings will occasionally be made to keep the Naiade in a good mood, so the waters will continually be blessed.
    If you swim in a place protected by a Naiade, you could absorb some of her magical qualities. These waters have often been known to heal the sick,  inspire poets, and bring fertility to women and crops.
    They are widely known for their beauty with flowing long hair and often roam around without clothes on leading both men and Gods falling to love with them. If she is provoked or a dramatic romance occurs, this will be reflected in the waters. She can unleash flash-floods, or inflict droughts on her enemies. She can change the quality of water making it undrinkable if she is irritated.
    Naiades can live as long as their body of water remains strong. If the water runs low, their strength slips away and could eventually die.</p>
<li>OCEANIDS</li>
<img src="images/OCEANIDS.jpg" alt="">
<p>An Oceanid is a water nymph that lives in the deep water of the ocean. There are more Oceanid than any other mermaid population. Important water Goddesses like Metis, who was Zeus‘ first wife, whom he later impregnated with Athena. Other important Oceanid Demigods are Amphitrite and Doris.
    Their main role is to protect the deep oceans and serve as wives and lovers to the Gods. They watch over their children who later become Gods themselves. Because of their compassion, many sailors dedicate prayers and sacrifices to the Oceanids in order to receive protection from the deadly sea storms.</p> 
<li>MERROW MERMAIDS</li>
<img src="images/MERROW MERMAIDS.jpg" alt="">
<p>Merrow Mermaids, also known as “wee folk”, are found in Ireland and have been known to have seaweed green hair and webbed fingers. If you are from Wales, these same mermaids are called Murgas. These particular mermaids are able to swim under the water with the aid of a magic red cap. If that cap is stolen, the merrow will not be able to return to their home underwater.
    Merrows have been known to fall in love with humans and even give birth to children. There are legends of Merrows singing to sailors and dragging them to the bottom of the sea. However, the Irish believe these men were enchanted and could stay alive under the water to enjoy the company of the mermaids.</p>
<li>CEASG-SCOTTISH MERMAIDS</li>    
<img src="images/CEASG - SCOTTISH MERMAIDS.jpg" alt="">
<p>A Ceasg (pronounced “kee-ask”) is known as a “maid of the waves” whose lower half resembles a salmon tail. These mermaids can be both dangerous and good fortune. If captured, she will grant you 3 wishes. If the captured mermaids and sailor find true love together, she will transform into a human and walk on land giving her husband good luck for the rest of his life.  Some Scottish families even claimed that their family descended from a mermaid-human couple.
    Don’t get on a Ceasgs bad side though! She will lure you to your death and not think twice about it.   
    The Ceasg can be immortal by putting their soul in an object, like a shell, and hid it so humans can’t find it. If you are a Harry Potter fan, this will sound familiar.</p>
